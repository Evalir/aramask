# Aramask ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦Š

Aragon account plugin for Metamask.

It allows DAO users to add a special contract account to their Metamask wallet and use it to manage [Aragon Agent](https://help.aragon.org/article/37-agent). It is based on a new [Metamask Plugin System](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-snaps-beta/wiki/Motivation).
